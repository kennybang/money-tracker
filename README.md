# Money tracker
A full-stack MERN application for managing personal finances, with a focus on tracking expenses and income. The app allows users to log transactions, categorize expenses, and view financial summaries. It is a bit similar to bookkeeping. Built with React.js, Node.js and Express, and MongoDB.

### Features
- **Add, Edit, and Delete Transactions**: Log income and expenses with details like category, amount, date, and description.
- **Category Management**: Add, edit, and delete custom categories for transactions to be categorized in.
- **CSV Import**: Upload CSV files with transaction data to quickly add multiple entries. This only works for CSV exported from Swedbank in Swedish.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter transactions by using date range and search.

### Getting Started

Install dependencies in both frontend and backend.
- Navigate to `frontend` and run: `npm install`
