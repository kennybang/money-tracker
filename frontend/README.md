# Money Tracker - Frontend

This is the frontend of the application, built with React and Vite.

### Features
- **Transaction Management**: Add, edit, and delete transactions with custom categories.
- **Category Management**: Add, edit, and delete custom categories.
- **CSV Import**: Upload CSV files with transaction data to quickly add multiple entries. This only works for CSV exported from Swedbank in Swedish.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter transactions by using date range and search.

### Getting Started
1. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
2. **Run the development server**: `npm run dev`
    - To run only the frontend: `npm run dev` 
    - To start both frontend and backend together, navigate to the backend folder and run `npm run dev` (uses `concurrently` to run both servers).
